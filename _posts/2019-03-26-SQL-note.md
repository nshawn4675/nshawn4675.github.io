## Intro
- SQL = **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage
- SQL lets you **access** and **manipulate** databases

## Syntax
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive : **select** is the same as **SELECT**.
```sql
-- 抓出所有資料
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
Some of The Most Important SQL Commands :

Commands				| Discription
:-----------------------|:-----------------------
[SELECT](#SELECT)		| extracts data from a database
[UPDATE](#UPDATE)		| updates data in a database
[DELETE](#DELETE)		| deletes data from a database
[INSERT INTO](#INSERT)	| inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE			| creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE			| modifies a database
CREATE TABLE			| creates a new table
ALTER TABLE				| modifies a table
DROP TABLE				| deletes a table
CREATE INDEX			| creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX				| deletes an index

<a name="SELECT"></a>
## SELECT
```sql
-- 抓出相對應column的資料
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name

-- 只抓出不同的資料
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
```

## WHERE
The **WHERE** clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
Operators in The WHERE Clause :

Operator	|	Description
:-----------|:-----------------
=			| Equal
>			| Greater than
<			| Less than
>=			| Greater than or equal
<=			| Less then or equal
<>			| Not equal. (In some version of SQL this operator may be written as !=)
BETWEEN		| Between a certain range
LIKE		| Search for a pattern
IN			| To specify multiple possible values for a column

# AND, OR and NOT Operators
```sql
/*
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR and NOT operators.
*/
SELECT column1, solumn2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 OR NOT condition3 ...;
```

## ORDER BY Keyword
The **ORDER BY** keyword is used to sort the result-set in **asc**ending(default) or **desc**ending order.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC
```
```sql
/*
多重排序，依 **ORDER BY** 順序做更詳細的排序。 
如下：依column1遞增排序完，根據column1相同值再對column2做遞減排序。
*/
SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
```

<a name="INSERT"></a>
## INSERT INTO
The **INSERT INTO** statement is used to insert new records in a table.
```sql
-- Method 1, value 存到相對應的 column
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

-- Method 2, value 存到 table 相對應順序的 column
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

## NULL Values
A field with a **NULL** value is a field with **no value**.  
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the **IS NULL** and **IS NOT NULL** operators instead.
```sql
-- 從 table_name 中取出 column_name 「是空」的資料
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL

-- 從 table_name 中取出 column_name 「不是」空的資料
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
```

<a name="UPDATE"></a>
## Update
The **UPDATE** statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
**Caution** : 此處的condition很重要，若忽略它，整個table的資料都會被改掉！！  
**Caution** : 此處的condition很重要，若忽略它，整個table的資料都會被改掉！！  
**Caution** : 此處的condition很重要，若忽略它，整個table的資料都會被改掉！！  

<a name="DELETE"></a>
## DELETE
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Caution** : 此處的condition很重要，若忽略它，整個table的資料都會被刪掉！！  
**Caution** : 此處的condition很重要，若忽略它，整個table的資料都會被刪掉！！  
**Caution** : 此處的condition很重要，若忽略它，整個table的資料都會被刪掉！！  
```sql
-- 相當於如下，
DELETE FROM table_name
```

## TOP, LIMIT or ROWNUM clause
The **SELECT TOP** clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records.  
Returning a large number of records can impact on performance.  
> **Note** : Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses ROWNUM.

```sql
-- SQL sServer / MS Access Syntax :
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

--MySQL Syntax :
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;

--Oracle Syntax :
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;
```
```sql
-- 從 table_name 中抓取前三筆資料的三個範例
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM table_name

SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT 3;

SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= 3;

-- 從 table_name 中抓取前 50% 筆資料
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM table_name

-- 也可從條件中取出前三筆資料的三個範例
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT 3;

SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE condition AND ROWNUM <= 3;
```

## MIN() and MAX() functions
The **MIN()** function returns the smallest value of the selected column.  
The **MAX()** function returns the largest value of the selected column.  
```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## COUNT(), AVG() and SUM() functions
The **COUNT()** function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria.  
The **AVG()** function returns the average value of a numeric column.  
The **SUM()** function returns the total sum of a numeric column.  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## LIKE Operator
The **LIKE** operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.  
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the **LIKE** operator :  
- % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
- _ - The underscore represents a single character

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
```

LIKE Operator					| Description
:-------------------------------|:-------------------------------------
WHERE Coulumn_name LIKE 'a%'	| Finds any values that start with "a"
WHERE Coulumn_name LIKE '%a'	| Finds any values that end with "a"
WHERE Coulumn_name LIKE '%or%'	| Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE Coulumn_name LIKE '_r%'	| Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE Coulumn_name LIKE 'a_%_%'	| Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE Coulumn_name LIKE 'a%o'	| Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

## Wildcards
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.  
Wildcard characters are used with the SQL LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.  

- Wildcard Characters in **MS Access**

Symbol	|	Description											|	Example
:-------|:------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------
*		| Represents zero or more characters					| bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob
?		| Represents a single character							| h?t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]		| Represents any single character within the brackets	| h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
!		| Represents any character not in the brackets			| h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-		| Represents a range of characters						| c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
#		| Represents any single numeric character				| 2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295

- Wildcard Characters in **SQL Server**

Symbol	|	Description											|	Example
:-------|:------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------
%		| Represents zero or more characters					| bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
_		| Represents a single character							| h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]		| Represents any single character within the brackets	| h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
^		| Represents any character not in the brackets			| h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-		| Represents a range of characters						| c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt

## IN Operator
The **IN** operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
```sql
-- Method 1
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

--Method 2
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
```
```sql
-- selects all customers that are from the same countries as the suppliers
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
```

## BETWEEN Operator
The **BETWEEN** operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.  
The **BETWEEN** operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```
```sql
-- selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

-- display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

-- selects all products with a price BETWEEN 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE (Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20)
AND NOT CategoryID IN (1, 2, 3);

-- selects all products with a ProductName BETWEEN Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'Mozzarella di Giovanni'
ORDER BY ProductName

-- selects all orders with an OrderDate BETWEEN '01-July-1996' and '31-July-1996':
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #01/07/1996# AND #31/07/1996#;

SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';
```

## Aliases
SQL **aliases** are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.  
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.  
An alias only exists for the duration of the query.
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name
```
```sql
-- creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customers
FROM Customers;

-- It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;

-- creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
-- SQL
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;
-- MySQL
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;

-- Alias for Tables
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName="Around the Horn" AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
```

## JOIN
A **JOIN** clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.  
#### Different Types of SQL JOINs :  
- INNER JOIN  
![inner_join](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/inner_join.png?raw=true)  
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```  
- LEFT JOIN  
![left_join](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/left_join.png?raw=true)  
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```  
- RIGHT JOIN  
![right_join](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/right_join.png?raw=true)  
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```  
- FULL OUTER JOIN  
![full_outer_join](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/full_outer_join.png?raw=true)  
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```  
- Self JOIN  
```sql
-- matches customers that are from the same city:
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City
```  

## UNION Operator  
The **UNION operator** is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.  
- Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns  
- The columns must also have similar data types  
- The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order

```sql
-- The UNION operator selects only distinct values by defaul :
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2

-- To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL :
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```
