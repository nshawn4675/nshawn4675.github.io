## Char Drivers  

- Take *scull* (Simple Character Utility for Loading Localities) for example.
- *scull* is not hardware dependent, it is a **device** which acts on some memory allocated from the kernel.
- *scull* is used to demonstrate the interface between the kernel and char drivers and allow the user to run some tests.

## The Design of scull  

- The first step of driver writing is definning the capabilities (the mechanism) the driver will offer to user programs.
- To make *scull* useful as a template for writing real drivers for real devices, the *scull* source implements the following device *types*:
    - *scull0* to *scull3*
        - Each consisting of a memory area that is both **global** and **persistent**.
        - **Global** means that if the device is opened multiple times, the data contained within the device is shared by all the file descriptors that opened it.
        - **Persistent** means that if the device is closed and reopened, data isn't lost.
        - Use cp, cat, echo, shell I/O redirection to play with it.
    - *scullpipe0* to *scullpipe3*
        - FIFO (first-in-first-out) devices.
        - If multiple processes read the same device, they contend for data.
        - Show how blocking and non-blocking *read* and *write* can be implemented without having to resort to interrupts.
    - *scullsingle*
        - Similar to *scull0* but it allows only one process at a time to use the driver.
    - *scullpriv*
        - Similar to *scull0* but it is private to each virtual console (or X terminal session). (processes on each console/terminal get different memory areas)
    - *sculluid*
        - Similar to *scull0*.
        - It can be opened multiple times, but only one user at a time.
        - Returns an error of "Device Busy" if another user is locking the device.
    - *scullwuid*
        - Similar to *scull0*.
        - It can be opened multiple times, but only one user at a time.
        - Implemented with blocking *open* if another user is locking the device.
- This chapter covers the internals of *scull0* to *scull3*, the more advanced devices are covered in Chapter 6. (Basic part as below)
    - open
    - release
    - read
    - write

## Major and Minor Numbers  
- char devices are accessed through names in the filesystem.
    - Usually in /dev/
    - identified by "c" in the first column of the output of *ls -l*.
    - major number identifies the driver associated with the device. (one-major-one-driver principle)
    - minor number is used by the kernel to determine exactly which device is being referred to.

![](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/maj_min.png?raw=true)

### The Internal Representation of Device Numbers  
``` C
#include <linux/types.h> // dev_t
#include <linux/kdev_t.h> // macros
dev_t dev_num;

// make dev_t with MKDEV(int major, int minor) macro
dev_num = MKDEV(1, 6);

// get MAJ with MAJOR(dev_t dev) macro
int maj = MAJOR(dev_num);

// get MIN with MINOR(dev_t dev) macro
int min = MINOR(dev_num);
```

### Allocating and Freeing Device Numbers  
- One of the first things your driver will need to do when setting up a char device is to obtain one or more device numbers to work with.
    ``` C
    #include <linux/fs.h>

    // Static approach
    int register_chrdev_regio(dev_t first, unsigned int count, char *name)
    ```

    - dev_t first
        - the beginning device number of the range you would like to allocate. 
        - The minor number portion is often 0.
    - unsigned int count
        - the total number of contiguous device number you are requesting.
    - char *name
        - the name of the device that should be associated with this number range.
        - it will appear in */proc/devices* and *sysfs*.
    - return 0 or negative error code.

    ``` C
    // Dynamic approach (recommended)
    int alloc_chrdev_region(dev_t *dev, unsigned int firstminor, unsigned int count, char *name);
    ```
    - dev_t *dev
        - output-only.
        - hold the first number in your allocated range if successed.
    - unsigned int firstminor
        - the requested first minor number to use. (usually 0)
    - unsigned int count
        - same as *register_chrdev_region*.
    - char *name
        - same as *register_chrdev_region*.
- You should free them when they are no longer in use.
    ``` C
    void unregister_chrdev_region(dev_t first, unsigned int count);
    ```

### Dynamic Allocation of Major Numbers  
- Strongly suggest that you use dynamic allocation to obtain major device number, rather than choosing a randomly free number.
- You can get your dynamic major number from */proc/devices* after calling *insmod*.

## Some Important Data Structures  
- three important kernel data structures.
    - file_operations
    - file
    - inode

### File Operations  
- The file_operations structure is how a char driver executes a specific operation.
    ``` C
    struct file_operations scull_fops = {
        .owner =    THIS_MODULE,
        .open =     scull_open,     /* self defined function*/
        .release =  scull_release,  /* self defined function*/
        .read =     scull_read,     /* self defined function*/
        .write =    scull_write,    /* self defined function*/
    }
    ```

    - struct module *owner
        - A pointer to the module that "owns" the structure.
        - Initialized to THIS_MODULE almost all the time.
    - int (*open) (struct inode *, struct file *);
        - The first operation performed on the device file.
    - int (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);
        - Invoked when the file structure is being released.
    - ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
        - Used to retrieve data from the device.
    - ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char __user *, size_t, loff_t *);
        - Sens data to the device.
    - Standard C tagged structure initialization syntax.
        - makes driver more portable across changes in the definitions of the structures.
        - makes the code more compact and readable.

### The file Structure  
- Has nothing to do with C library FILE pointer.
- The file structure represents an *openfile*.
- We'll consistently call the pointer *filp* to prevent ambiguities with the structure itself.
- Important fields of struct file:
    - mode_t;
        - It identifies the file as either readable or writable (or both).
    - loff_t f_pos;
        - The current reading or writing position.
    - unsigned int f_flags;
        - file_flags, such as O_RDONLY, O_NONBLOCK, and O_SYNC.
        - <linux/fcntl.h>
    - struct file_operations *f_op;
        - The operations associated with the file.
    - void *private_data;
        - It is a useful resource for preserving state information across system calls.
        - You must remember to free that memory in the *release* method before the *file* structure is destroyed by the kernel.
    - Drivers never create file structures, they only access structures created elsewhere.

### The inode Structure  
- The *inode* structure is used by the kernel internally to represent files. There can be numerous *file* structures representing multiple open descriptors on a single file, but they all point to a single *inode* structure.
- Two fields of this structure are of interest for writing driver code:
    - dev_t i_rdev;
        - For inodes that represent device files, this field contains the actual device number.
    - struct cdev *i_cdev;
        - It is the kernel's internal structure that represents char devices.
    - Instead of manipulating *i_rdev* directly, you can obtain the major and minor number from an inode by:
        ``` C
        unsigned int iminor(struct inode *inode);
        unsigned int imajor(struct inode *inode);
        ```
    
## Char Device Registration  
- Two ways of allocating and initializaing.
    ``` C
    #include <linux/cdev.h>
    
    struct cdev *my_cdev = cdev_alloc();
    my_cdev->ops = &my_fops;

    void cdev_init(struct cdev *cdev, struct file_operations *fops);
    ```
- After allocating and initializaing, set *struct cdev **owner*** field to THIS_MODULE.  
- The final step is to tell the kernel about it.
    ``` C
    int cdev_add(struct cdev *dev, dev_t num, unsigned int count);
    ```
    - struct cdev *dev
        - The *cdev* structure.
    - dev_t num
        - The first device number.
    - unsigned int count
        - the number of device numbers. (often 1)
    - *cdev_add* can fail.
    - Device is "live" and its operations can be called by the kernel after *cdev_add* successed. So you should not call *cdev_add* until your driver is completely ready to handle operations on the device.
- To remove a char device from the system:
    ``` C
    void cdev_del(struct cdev *dev);
    ```
    - Do not access the cdev structure after passing it to *cdev_del*.

### Device Registration in scull  
- The structure of *scull*.
    ``` C
    struct scull_dev {
        struct scull_qset *data;    /* Pointer to first quantum set */
        int quantum;                /* the current quantum size */
        int qset;                   /* the current array size */
        unsigned long size;         /* amount of data stored here */
        struct semaphore sem;       /* mutual exclusion semaphore */
        struct cdev cdev;           /* Char device structure */
    };
    ```
- Initialize *scull* and added to the system.
    ``` C
    static void scull_setup_cdev(struct scull_dev *dev, int index) {
        int err, devno = MKDEV(scull_major, scull_minor + index);

        cdev_init(&dev->cdev, &scull_fops);
        dev->cdev.owner = THIS_MODULE;
        err = cdev_add(&dev->cdev, devno, 1);
        /* Fail gracefully if need be */
        if (err)
            printk(KERN_NOTICE "Error %d add scull%d", err, index);
    }
    ```

## open and release  
### The open Method  
- *open* should perform the following tasks:
    - Check for device-specific errors (such as device-not-ready or similar hardware problems)
    - Initialize the device if it is being opened for the first time
    - Update the *f_op* pointer, if neccessary.
    - Allocate and fill any data structure to be put in *filp->private_data*.
- Prototype of *open*
    ``` C
    int (*open)(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp);
    ```
- Get *scull_structure* from *inode*
    ``` C
    #include <linux/kernel.h>
    
    struct scull_dev *dev; /* device information */

    dev = container_of(inode->i_cdev, struct scull_dev, cdev);
    filp->private_data = dev; /* for other methods in the future */
    ```
    - container_of(pointer, conainer_type, container_field);
        - This macro takes a *pointer* to a field of type *container_field*, within a structure of type *container_type*, and returns a pointer to the containing structure.
- The *scull_open* function:
    ``` C
    int scull_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp) {
        struct scull_dev *dev; /* device information */

        dev = container_of(inode->i_cdev, struct scull_dev, cdev);
        filp->private_data = dev; /* for other methods in the future */

        /* now trim to 0 the length of the device if open was write-only */
        if ( (filp->f_flags & O_ACCMODE) == O_WRONLY) {
            if (mutex_lock_interruptible(&dev->lock))
                return -ERESTARTSYS;
            scull_trim(dev); /* ignore errors */
            mutex_unlock(&dev->lock);
        }
        return 0; /* success */
    })
    ```
    
### The release Method  
- The reverse of *open*.
- Sometimes it is called *close*.
- *release* should perform the following tasks:
    - Deallocate anything that open allocated in *filp->private_data*.
    - Shut down the device on last close.
- The *close* system call executes the *release* method only when the counter for the *file* structure drops to 0.

## scull's Memory Usage  
``` C
#include <linux/slab.h>

void *kmalloc(size_t size, int flags);
void kfree(void *ptr);
```
- A call to *kmalloc* attempts to allocate *size* bytes of memory; the return value is a pointer to that memory or *NULL* if the allocation fails. The *flags* argument is used to describe how the memory should be allocated.
- *kmalloc* is not the most efficient way to allocate large areas of memory.
- The layout of a scull device

    ![](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/scull_mem_layout.png?raw=true)

    ``` C
    struct scull_qset {
        void **data;
        struct scull_qset *next;
    }
    ```
- scull_trim function:
    ``` C
    int scull_trim(struct scull_dev *dev) {
        struct scull_qset *next, *dptr;
        int qset = dev->qset; /* "dev" is not-null */
        int i;

        for (dptr=dev->data; dptr; dptr=next) { /* all the list items */
            if (dptr->data) {
                for (i=0; i<qset; i++)
                    kfree(dptr->data[i]);
                kfree(dptr->data);
                dptr->data = NULL;
            }
            next = dptr->next;
            kfree(dptr);
        }
        dev->size = 0;
        dev->quantum = scull_quantum;
        dev->qset = scull_qset;
        dev->data = NULL;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

## read and write  
- The *read* and *write* prototyes:
    ``` C
    ssize_t read(struct file *filp, char __user *buff, size_t count, loff_t *offp);
    ssize_t write(struct file *filp, const char __user *buff, size_t count, loff_t *offp);
    ```
    - struct file *filp
        - The file pointer.
    - size_t count
        - the size of requested data transfer.
    - char __user *buff
        - The pointer points to the **user buffer**.
        - (write) It holds the data to be written.
        - (read) The empty buffer where the newly read data should be placed.
    - loff_t *offp
        - A pointer points to a "long offset type" object that indicates the file position the user is accessing.
- To ensure the data transfers between kernel and user space happen in a safe and correct way, use the following methods:
    ``` C
    #include <asm/uaccess.h>

    unsigned long copy_to_user(void __user *to, const void *from, unsigned long count);
    unsigned long copy_from_user(void *to, const void __user *from, unsigned long count);
    ```
- The task of the *read* method is to copy data from the device to user space.
- The *write* method must copy data from user space to the device.
- Whatever the amount of data the methods transfer, they should generally update the file opsition at **offp*.

![](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/the_arguments_to_read.png?raw=true)

### The read Method  
- The return value (*retval*) for *read*:
    - *retval* == *count*
        - The requested number of bytes has been transferred. This is optimal case.
    - 0 < *retval* < *count*
        - Only part of the data has been transferred.
        - Most often, the application program retries the read.
    - 0 == *retval*
        - End-of-file was reached.
    - *retval* < 0
        - There was an error.
        - Check <linux/errno.h>
        - Typical values
            - -EINTR (interrupted system call)
            - -EFAULT (bad address)
- The *read* function
    ``` C
    ssize_t scull_read(struct file *filp, char __user *buf, size_t count, loff_t *f_pos) {
        struct scull_dev *dev = filp->private_data;
        struct scull_qset *dptr; /* the first listitem */
        int quantum = dev->quantum, qset = dev->qset;
        int itemsize = quantum * qset; /* how many bytes in the listitem */
        int item, rest, s_pos, q_pos;
        ssize_t retval = 0;

        if (mutex_lock_interruptible(&dev->lock))
            return -ERESTARTSYS;
        if (dev->size <= *f_pos)
            goto out;
        if (dev->size < *f_pos + count)
            count = dev->size - *f_pos;

        /* find listitem, qset index, and offset in the quantum */
        item = (long)*f_pos / itemsize;
        rest = (long)*f_pos % itemsize;
        s_pos = rest / quantum; q_pos = rest % quantum;

        /* follow the list up to the right position (defined elsewhere) */
        dptr = scull_follow(dev, item);

        if (dptr == NULL || !dptr->data || !dptr->data[s_pos])
            goto out; /* don't fill holes */
        
        /* read only up to the end of this quantum */
        if (quantum - q_pos < count)
            count = quantum - q_pos;

        if (copy_to_user(buf, dptr->data[s_pos] + q_pos, count)) {
            retval = -EFAULT;
            goto out;
        }
        *f_pos += count;
        retval = count;

    out:
        mutex_unlock(&dev->lock);
        return retval;
    }
    ```

### The write Method  
- The return value (*retval*) for *write*:
    - *retval* == *count*
        - The requested number of bytes has been transferred.
    - 0 < *retval* < *count*
        - Only part of the data has been transferred.
        - The program will most likely retry writing the rest of the data.
    - 0 == *retval*
        - Nothing was written.
        - Examine the exact meaning of this case in CH6.
    - *retval* < 0
        - An error occurred; as for *read*.

- The *write* function
    ``` C
    ssize_t scull_write(struct file *filp, const char __user *buf, size_t count, loff_t *f_pos) {
        struct scull_dev *dev = filp->private_data;
        struct scull_qset *dptr;
        int quantum = dev->quantum, qset = dev->qset;
        int itemsize = quantum * qset;
        int item, rest, s_pos, q_pos;
        ssize_t retval = -ENOMEM; /* value used in "goto out" statements */
    
        if (mutex_lock_interruptible(&dev->lock))
            return -ERESTARTSYS;

        /* find listitem, qset index and offset in the quantum */
        item = (long)*f_pos / itemsize;
        rest = (long)*f_pos % itemsize;
        s_pos = rest / quantum; q_pos = rest % quantum;

        /* follow the list up to the right position */
        dptr = scull_follow(dev, item);
        if (dptr == NULL)
            goto out;
        if (!dptr->data) {
            dptr->data = kmalloc(qset * sizeof(char *), GFP_KERNEL);
            if (!dptr->data)
                goto out;
            memset(dptr->data, 0, qset * sizeof(char *));
        }
        if (!dptr->data[s_pos]) {
            dptr->data[s_pos] = kmalloc(quantum, GFP_KERNEL);
            if (!dptr->data[s_pos])
                goto out;
        }
        /* write only up to the end of this quantum */
        if (quantum - q_pos < count)
            count = quantum - q_pos;

        if (copy_from_user(dptr->data[s_pos] + q_pos, buf, count)) {
            retval = -EFAULT;
            goto out;
        }
        *f_pos += count;
        retval = count;

        /* update the size */
        if (dev->size < *f_pos)
            dev->size = *f_pos;
    
    out:
        mutex_unlock(&dev->lock);
        return retval;
    }
    ```

### readv and writev  
- These "vector" versions of *read* and *write* take an array of structures, each of which contains a pointer to a buffer and a length value.
- If your driver does not supply methods to handle the vector operations, *readv* and *writev* are implemented with multiple calls to your *read* and *write* methods.
- The prototypes for the vector operations are:
    ``` C
    ssize_t (*readv) (struct file *filp, const struct iovec *iov, unsigned long count, loff_t *ppos);
    ssize_t (*writev) (struct file *filp, const struct iovec *iov, unsigned long count, loff_t *ppos);
    ```
- The *iovec* struct:
    ``` C
    #include <linux/uio.h>

    struct iovec {
        void __user *iov_base;
        __kernel_size_t iov_len;
    };
    ```

## Playing with the New Devices  
- Once you are equipped with the four methods (open, release, read, write) just described, the driver can be compiled and tested.
- You can try using *cp*, *dd*, and input/output redirection to test out the driver.
