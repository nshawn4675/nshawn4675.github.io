## Role of Device driver  
1. **Black boxes** between user(applications) and hardware.
    ![](https://github.com/nshawn4675/nshawn4675.github.io/blob/master/_pic/device_driver_blackbox.png?raw=true)
2. Provide **mechanism** (what capabilities are to be provided) instead of **policy**(how those capabilities can be used)

## Splitting the Kernel  
1. Process management
2. Memory management
3. Filesystems
4. Device control
5. Networking

## Loadable Modules  
- Extend kernel functionality at runtime. (like a slime?)

## Classes of Devices and Modules  
- char devices
    - open, close, read, write.
    - sequence stream access. (can't move back and forth in the regular file)
    - e.g., /dev/tty1.
- block devices
    - can host a filesystem.
    - only handle I/O operations that transfer one or more whole blocks.
    - e.g., /dev/sda
- network interface
    - no file node in /dev/.
    - send / receive data packets.
    - e.g., eth0

## Security Issues  
- If the kernel has security holes, then the system as a whole has holes.
- Security is a **policy** issue that is often best handled at higher levels within the kernel.
- e.g., buffer overrun, information leakage, etc.

## Version Numbering  
- stable: even-numbered kernel versions. (i.e., 2.6.x)

## License Terms  
- Version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL v2)

## Joining the Kernel Development Community  
- linux-kernel mailing list.
