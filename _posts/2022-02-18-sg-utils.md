## Introduction  

- Send SCSI commands to devices on transports traditionally associated with SCSI.
    - Fibre Channel (FCP)
    - Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
    - SCSI Parallel Interface (SPI)
    - ATAPI cd/dvd drivers and SATA disks connect via a translation layer or a bridge that use SCSI command sets.
- SCSI command sets
    - [SCSI Standards Architecture](https://www.t10.org/scsi-3.htm)
    - common set
        - SCSI Primary Commands (SPC)
        - SPC-5 [INCITS 502-2019]
        - mandatory SCSI INQUIRY
    - SCSI Block Commands (SBC)
        - direct access devices such as disks.
    - MultiMedia Commands (MMC)
        - cover CD, DVD and BD drives and the media within them.

| sg_wr_mode | MODE SELECT [6, 10] | getopt | f,s,t,w | writes mode pages supplied in ASCII hex (e.g., from "sg_modes -r") to the SCSI device.<br/>See [sdparm](https://sg.danny.cz/sg/sdparm.html) for another method of setting mode page parameters. |
| sg_xcopy | EXTENDED COPY(LID1) | dd |  | Uses the EXTENDED COPY(LID1) command to copy between disks.<br/>Note: the [ddpt](https://sg.danny.cz/sg/ddpt.html) utility contains this functionality and adds ODX (a subset of XCOPY(LID4)) capability.<br/>ddpt is ported to f,s,w.<br/>Note that "LID1" EXTENDED COPY commands have been removed from SPC-5 drafts.<br/>The remaining "LID4" commands in SPC-5 have dropped the "LID4" suffix. |

## Exit status  

| Exit status | Description |
|:----------- |:----------- |
| 0 | no error detected. Utility completed successfully |
| 1 | syntax error in command line options or their arguments, or an illegal combination of options |
| 2 | the device reports that it is not ready for the operation requested. The device may be in the process of becoming ready (e.g., spinning up but not at speed) so the utility may work a little while later |
| 3 | the device reports a medium or hardware error (or a blank check). For example an attempt to read a corrupted block on a disk will yield this value |
| 5 | the device reports an "illegal request" with an additional sense code other than "invalid operation code". This is often a supported command with a field set requesting an unsupported capability. For commands that require a "service action" field (e.g., READ CAPACITY(16)) this value can indicate that the command is not supported |
| 6 | the device reports a "unit attention" condition. This usually indicate that something, unrelated to the requested command, has occurred (e.g., a device reset) potentially before the current SCSI command was sent. The requested command has not been executed by the device. Note that unit attention conditions are usually only reported once by a device |
| 7 | the device reports a "data protect" sense key. This implie some mechanism has blocked writes (or possibly all access to the media). |
| 9 | the device reports an illegal request with an additional sense code of "invalid operation code" which means that the device doesn't support the requested command |
| 10 | the device reports a "copy aborted" sense key |
| 11 | the device (or transport) reports and aborted command. In some cases this can be caused by congestion on the transport and retrying the command may be successful |
| 14 | the device reports a "miscompare" sense key. sg_verify and sg_compare_and_write may report this. |
| 15 | the utility is unable to open, close or use the given device or another file. The given file name could be incorrect or there may be permission problems. Adding the '-v' option may give more information "
| 17 | a SCSI "Illegal request" sense code received with a flag indicating the Info field is valid. |
| 18 | the DEVICE reports a medium or hardware error (or a blank check) with a flag indicating the Info field is valid. This is often a LBA (of the first encountered error) but its meaning is command specific. |
| 20 | the device reports it has a check condition but "no sense". Some polling commands (e.g., REQUEST SENSE) can react this way. It is unlikely that this value will occur as an exit status |
| 21 | the device reports a "recovered error". The requested command was successful. Most likely a utility will report a recovered error to stderr and continue, probably leaving the utility with an wxit status of 0. |
| 22 | LBA out-of-range |
| 24 | the device reports a SCSI status of "reservation conflict". This implies that some other initiator holds a reservation on this device; that reservation may block writes or almost all access to that device via the current initiator |
| 25 | the device reports a SCSI status of "condition met". Currently only the PRE-FETCH command (see SBC-4) yields this status. |
| 26 | the device reports a SCSI status of "busy". SAM-5 defines this status as the logical unit is temporarily unable to process a command. It is recommended to re-issue the command. |
| 27 | the device reports a SCSI status of "task set full". |
| 28 | the device reports a SCSI status of "ACA active". ACA is "auto contingent allegiance" and is seldom used. |
| 29 | the device reports a SCSI status of "task aborted". SAM-5 says: "This status shall be returned if a command is aborted by a command or task management function on another I_T nexus and the Control mode page TAS bit is set to one". |
| 31 | error involving two or more command line options, or a missing second option that is needed. Often two or more options contradict one another. These tend to be more complicated than "syntax error" (exit status 1) which typically are associated with a single command line option. |
| 32 | there is a logic error in the utility's code. This may warrant an email to the author. |
| 33 | the command sent to the device has timed out. This occurs in Linux, in other ports a command timeout will appear as a transport (or OS) error |
| 34 | this is a Windows only exit status and indicates that the Windows error number (32 bits) cannot meaningfully be mapped to an equivalent Unix error number returned as the exit status (7 bits) |
| 36 | no error has occurred plus the utility wants to convey a boolean value of **false**. The corresponding **true** value is conveyed by a 0 exit status. |
| 40 | the command sent to device has received an "aborted command" sense key with an additional sense code of 0x10. This is related to problems with protection information (PI or DIF). Examples include reading unmapped blocks or blocks that have never been written to (since the last format) |
| 41 | similar to error code 40 plus a flag indicating the Info field is valid |
| 48 | An NVMe command terminated with a non-zero status (stats = ((SCT <<8) | SC)) |
| 49 | Low Level Driver (LLD) reports a residual count that is too high. This means that not enough data has been returned from the device (i.e., the "data-in" buffer) to continue. |
| 50 | A Unix error ("errno") has occurred and its value is too large (46<) to fit in the alotted range which is 51 to 95. Since errno=0 means there is no error, this value (50) is used to map all "too large" error_s to. |
| 51-96 | This is a Unix "errno" value plus 50. Unix errno values are relatively small positive integers. Errno values 1 through 46 are mapped to 51 to 96. All larger errno values are mapped to 50. |
| 97 | the response to a SCSI command failed sanity checks |
| 98 | the device reports it has a check condition but the error doesn't fit into any of the above categories |
| 99 | any errors that can't be categorized into values 1 to 98 may yield this value. This includes transport and operating system errors |
| 100-125 | used by the ddpt utility, mainly for specialized offloaded copy errors. |
| 126 | utility found but could not be executed. Possibly a permissions problem or executable is for a different architecture |
| 127 | utility not found |
| 128+ | utility was interrupted by signal <signum> |
| 255 | utility tried to yield an exit status of 255 or higher |
